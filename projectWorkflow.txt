# BER Project - Complete Workflow Guide for Testing & Demo
## Budget Execution & Reporting System (BER)

---

## üéØ PROJECT OVERVIEW

**What to Say:** "This is a comprehensive Budget Execution and Reporting (BER) system designed for enterprise-level budget management. It integrates Node.js backend with OpenLDAP authentication, MySQL database, and a modern web interface. The system handles the complete budget lifecycle from project creation to invoice approval."

---

## üèóÔ∏è SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

**What to Say:** "Our system follows a modern three-tier architecture:
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript with responsive design
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Database**: MySQL for data persistence
- **Authentication**: OpenLDAP for enterprise-grade security
- **Containerization**: Docker for easy deployment and scalability"

---

## üöÄ PRE-DEMO SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Step 1: Start Docker Services
```bash
# Start Docker Desktop first
# Then run:
docker-compose up -d
```

**What to Say:** "First, I'll start our containerized services. We're using Docker to ensure consistent deployment across different environments. This starts our MySQL database and OpenLDAP authentication server."

### Step 2: Start the Application
```bash
npm start
```

**What to Say:** "Now I'm starting our Node.js application server. You can see it's running on port 3000. The server handles all our business logic and API endpoints."

## üîê AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM DEMO

### Available Test Users:
- **User Role**: `user1` / `password123`
- **Manager Role**: `manager1` / `password123` 
- **Admin Role**: `adminuser` / `admin123`

**What to Say:** "Our system uses OpenLDAP for enterprise authentication. We have three user roles with different permissions:
- **Users** can create projects, submit budgets, and manage invoices
- **Managers** can approve budgets, AFEs, and invoices
- **Admins** have full system access and can view all reports"

### Demo Login Flow:
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Login with `user1` / `password123`
3. Show the user dashboard

**What to Say:** "Here's our login interface. Notice the clean, professional design. After authentication, users are redirected to role-specific dashboards."

## üìã CORE FUNCTIONALITY DEMO

### 1. PROJECT MANAGEMENT

**What to Say:** "Let's start with project creation. In our system, everything flows from projects. Projects contain tasks, which contain work elements, which have budgets."

#### Demo Steps:
1. **Create a Project**
   - Fill in: Project Name, Description, Start/End Dates
   - Submit the form
   
**What to Say:** "I'm creating a new project called 'Eagle Ridge Development'. This represents a real-world oil and gas development project."

2. **Show Project Approval**
   - Switch to manager account (`manager1` / `password123`)
   - Navigate to "Pending Projects"
   - Approve the project

**What to Say:** "Now I'm switching to the manager role to approve this project. Notice how the system enforces role-based permissions."

### 2. BUDGET MANAGEMENT

**What to Say:** "Once a project is approved, we can create budgets. Budgets are tied to specific work elements within tasks."

#### Demo Steps:
1. **Create Tasks and Work Elements**
   - Add a task to the approved project
   - Create work elements under the task
   
**What to Say:** "Tasks represent major project phases, and work elements are specific activities within those phases."

2. **Submit Budget**
   - Create a budget for a work element
   - Set amount and description
   
**What to Say:** "I'm creating a budget of $500,000 for drilling equipment. This budget will need manager approval."

3. **Budget Approval Process**
   - Switch to manager role
   - Approve the budget

**What to Say:** "The approval process ensures proper oversight and control over budget allocations."

### 3. AFE (Authorization for Expenditure) WORKFLOW

**What to Say:** "AFEs are authorizations to spend money from approved budgets. They provide detailed breakdowns of planned expenditures."

#### Demo Steps:
1. **Submit AFE**
   - Select approved project and budget
   - Fill in AFE details: title, description, amount
   - Add activity details: unit, quantity, unit price
   
**What to Say:** "I'm creating an AFE for $50,000 worth of drilling equipment. Notice how the system calculates the total cost automatically."

2. **AFE Approval**
   - Switch to manager role
   - Review and approve AFE

**What to Say:** "Managers can review AFE details and approve or decline them based on business needs."

### 4. INVOICE MANAGEMENT

**What to Say:** "Invoices are submitted against approved AFEs. This ensures that all expenditures are properly authorized."

#### Demo Steps:
1. **Submit Invoice**
   - Select approved AFE
   - Fill in invoice details: vendor, amount, description
   - Upload invoice document (optional)
   
**What to Say:** "I'm submitting an invoice from our equipment vendor. The system validates that we have an approved AFE before allowing invoice submission."

2. **Invoice Approval**
   - Manager reviews and approves invoice

**What to Say:** "The approval process maintains financial control and ensures all expenditures are properly documented."

### 5. BUDGET CHANGE REQUESTS (BCR)

**What to Say:** "BCRs allow for budget transfers between work elements when project needs change."

#### Demo Steps:
1. **Submit BCR**
   - Select source and destination budgets
   - Specify transfer amount and reason
   
**What to Say:** "I'm requesting to transfer $25,000 from one work element to another due to changing project requirements."

2. **BCR Approval**
   - Manager reviews and approves BCR
   
**What to Say:** "The system automatically updates both budgets when the BCR is approved."

## üìä REPORTING & ANALYTICS

**What to Say:** "Our system provides comprehensive reporting capabilities for management oversight."

### Available Reports:
1. **Approved Projects Report**
2. **Budget Status Report**
3. **Production Data Report**
4. **Invoice Tracking Report**

**What to Say:** "These reports provide real-time visibility into project status, budget utilization, and financial performance."
