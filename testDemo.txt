## 🔧 **Core Functionality & How It Works**

### **1. Authentication System (OpenLDAP)**
**How it works:** The application uses OpenLDAP for centralized user management and authentication. When users log in, their credentials are verified against the LDAP directory, and their role (user, manager, admin) is retrieved and stored in their session.

**Key Functions:**
- `checkAuth()`: Middleware that verifies if a user is logged in before allowing access to protected routes
- `isAdmin()`: Middleware that ensures only admin users can access admin-specific features
- `isManager()`: Middleware that allows both managers and admins to access manager features

**Automated Testing:** Unit tests verify that authentication middleware correctly allows/denies access based on user roles and session state.

### **2. Project Management System**
**How it works:** Users can create projects with descriptions, which are stored in the MySQL database. Projects follow a hierarchical structure: Project → Tasks → Work Elements → Budgets.

**Key Functions:**
- Project creation with validation
- Task assignment to projects
- Work element creation within tasks
- Status tracking (pending → approved)

**Automated Testing:** Integration tests verify the complete project creation workflow and database operations.

### **3. Budget Management System**
**How it works:** Budgets are associated with work elements and can be submitted, approved, and modified through Budget Change Requests (BCRs). The system maintains mathematical accuracy and audit trails.

**Key Functions:**
- `calculateBudgetTransfer()`: Handles budget transfers between projects with validation
- `validateBudgetChange()`: Validates BCR data for completeness and accuracy
- `approveBudgetChange()`: Processes approved transfers and updates related budgets

**Automated Testing:** Unit tests verify budget calculations are mathematically correct, and integration tests ensure the complete BCR workflow functions properly.

### **4. Role-Based Access Control**
**How it works:** The application implements a three-tier role system where each role has specific permissions and access levels.

**User Role:** Can create projects, submit budgets, and request budget changes
**Manager Role:** Can approve projects, budgets, and budget change requests
**Admin Role:** Can view comprehensive reports and audit trails

**Automated Testing:** Authentication tests verify that each role can only access appropriate features and data.

### **5. Database Operations & Data Integrity**
**How it works:** All data operations use parameterized SQL queries to prevent SQL injection and maintain data consistency. Transactions ensure that related operations succeed or fail together.

**Key Operations:**
- Project CRUD operations with proper validation
- Budget management with transaction safety
- BCR processing with audit trail maintenance
- Admin reporting with filtered queries

**Automated Testing:** Database tests verify SQL operations, error handling, and data integrity constraints.

### **Part 1: Introduction & The Standard User**

**What to Say:** "Hello, this is the BER project. It's a web application built with Node.js that manages projects, budgets, and production data with a three-tiered role system: user, manager, and admin. Authentication and role management are handled by an OpenLDAP server, and all the services are containerized with Docker. I've implemented comprehensive automated testing to ensure code quality and reliability."

**What to Do:**
1. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Login as `user1` with password `password123`.

**What to Say:** "I've logged in as a standard user. This user's role is to submit new projects and their initial budgets for approval. The authentication system uses OpenLDAP to verify credentials and assign roles."
    
**What to Do:**
1. Create a project named `Project Alpha` with a description.
2. Create a second project named `Project Beta`.
3. Go to `Project Alpha`, add a task `Task A1`, a work element `WE-A1.1`, and submit a budget of **$10,000**.
4. Go to `Project Beta`, add a task `Task B1`, a work element `WE-B1.1`, and submit a budget of **$5,000**.

**What to Say:** "I've just created two projects and submitted their initial budgets. These are now in a pending state, waiting for a manager to approve them. The user cannot proceed until this approval is granted. The system maintains data integrity through MySQL transactions and validates all inputs. Now, I'll log out and show you the manager's perspective."

**What to Do:** Log out.

---

### **Part 2: The Manager Role**

**What to Say:** "Now I'm logging in as a manager. The manager's role is to oversee projects and approve or deny requests from users. The role-based access control system ensures managers can only access appropriate features."

**What to Do:**
1. Login as `manager1` with password `password123`.
2. Navigate to the project and budget approval queues.

**What to Say:** "As you can see, the manager's dashboard shows the pending requests submitted by the user. I can now review and approve them. The system uses Express.js middleware to control access based on user roles."

**What to Do:**
1. Approve `Project Alpha` and `Project Beta`.
2. Approve the **$10,000** and **$5,000** budgets.

**What to Say:** "With the projects and budgets approved, the user can now submit production data and request budget changes. The manager is also responsible for approving these changes. The database operations maintain audit trails of all approvals."

### **Part 3: Submitting and Approving Changes**

**What to Say:** "I'll log back in as the user to demonstrate the next step in the workflow."

**What to Do:**
1. Log out and log back in as `user1`.
2. Navigate to the "Submit Budget Change" section.

**What to Say:** "Let's say Project Beta needs more funding, and Project Alpha has a surplus. The user can submit a Budget Change Request, or BCR, to transfer funds. The system validates the request and ensures mathematical accuracy."

**What to Do:**
1. Submit a BCR to transfer **$2,000** from `Project Alpha` (`WE-A1.1`) to `Project Beta` (`WE-B1.1`). Use `BCR-001` as the number.
2. Log out.

**What to Say:** "That request is now pending approval. The system has validated the BCR data and stored it in the database. I'll log in as the manager one last time to approve it."

**What to Do:**
1. Login as `manager1`.
2. Navigate to the "Pending Budget Changes" queue and approve `BCR-001`.
3. Log out.
